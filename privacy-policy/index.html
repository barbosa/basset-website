  <h2>Basset Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p><strong>Last Updated: Dec 7, 2019</strong></p>
  <p>Basset and its licensors (collectively, “Basset”) is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals who visit
    our websites (“Visitors”), companies that subscribe to our Services (“Customers”) and individuals who use our
    Services via a Customer subscription (“Users”).</p>
  <p>In this policy, the terms “we”, “us”, or “our” refer to Basset, and the terms “you” and “your” refer to Users,
    individually and collectively. The term “your company” refers to the Customer subscription through which a User
    accesses our Service. The term “Personal Information” means information about an identifiable individual.</p>
  <p><strong>1. Overview and Scope</strong></p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the Basset website located at https://www.basset.io, any related Basset websites and
    domains, Basset’s mobile applications, and any of the products or services owned, operated, or controlled by Basset,
    including without limitation, the Basset Software Services (collectively, the “Services”) located at
    https://app.basset.io.</p>
  <p>Our Services are intended to be used by Customers (collectively, “Users”) to track, measure, manage and review
    visual regression differences on a continuous basis. We provide our Services via a subscription contracted with our
    Customers, and the information we collect in performance of those contracts is on behalf of and at the express
    instruction of our Customers. As a service provider, we require our Customers to ensure that they have obtained all
    authority to provide personal information to us in accordance with applicable privacy laws. We do not collect or use
    personal information of our Customers for any purpose other than to provide Services on behalf of our customers or
    as required by applicable law.</p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices, such as the information we may collect, how we may collect
    this information, how we may use and disclose this information, who we might share this information with, the
    security measures utilized to secure this information, and how to contact us with any inquiries related to your
    information. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into the Master Subscription Agreement or other agreement entered
    into between Basset and the Customer.</p>
  <p><strong>2. Types of Information We Collect and Use</strong></p>
  <p><strong>2.1 Account Information</strong></p>
  <p>When you create or establish an account for the Services, we collect and store information about you based on
    information you or your company may provide, which may include your name, email address, your organization, a unique
    identifier, a profile picture, password, and any other information that may identify you individually. We use this
    information to set up your account, to give you the appropriate access and permissions, to communicate with you
    regarding your account, and otherwise for the provision of the Services on behalf of your company. We may also use
    your email address to send you updates in connection with the Services or Basset on behalf of your company.
  </p>
  <p><strong>2.2 Hosted Data</strong></p>
  <p>When you use and interact with the Services, any information that you post, upload, store, display, transmit, or
    submit on or through the Services will be collected and stored through your direct interactions with the Services as
    Hosted Data.
  </p>
  <p>When you log in to, use and interact with the Service, we collect and store the information or content that you
    post, upload, store, display, transmit, or submit through the Service (collectively, “Hosted Data”). Except to the
    extent necessary to render the Services on behalf of your company or where required by applicable law, Basset does
    not access any Hosted Data. Basset only accesses the information to the extent necessary to provide the Services and
    any related support for the Services. By default most Hosted Data is public to other Users inside your organization
    using the Services. You are solely responsible for all Hosted Data that ou post, upload, store, display, transmit,
    or submit on the Services, including Personal Information, and the consequences thereof. Basset is not responsible
    and will not be liable for the Hosted Data you disclose while using the Services.</p>
  <p><strong>2.3 Third Party Integrations</strong></p>
  <p>When our Services are integrated with third party applications (“Third Party Integrations”), we may receive,
    collect, and store information via the applicable third party application, such as your user name, a unique user
    identifier, information you or your company have authorized such Third Party Integration to share (e.g., a set of
    artifacts in a tool, made available through the Integration), and related metadata for the purposes of facilitating
    the integration on behalf of your company.</p>
  <p><strong>2.4 Information Obtained from Third Party Authenticators</strong></p>
  <p>If you log in to the Services using a third party sign-in provider to authenticate your account for the Services
    (e.g., Github, GitLab or other SAML services) (“Third Party Authenticators”), we may receive, collect, and
    store information regarding your credentials for the applicable Third Party Authenticator, such as your user name,
    your email, your unique user identifier, profile picture, and other information you have authorized such Third Party
    Authenticator to share. This information is used for the purposes of creating and administering your account on
    behalf of your company.</p>
  <p><strong>2.6 Technical Data</strong></p>
  <p>We collect de-identified technical data about how Users interact with our systems. Basset may collect and use
    technical data about your session, application interactions, device, operating system, application software, and
    peripherals (collectively, “Technical Data”). We collect and use Technical Data to facilitate software updates,
    provide support, and continuously make improvements to the Services and our business. Basset may also aggregate the
    metadata and usage data of the Services, including Hosted Data, so that the resulting data and statistics are not
    personally identifiable to any individual User (“Aggregated Data”). We may collect and use Aggregated Data (i) for
    our own internal statistical analysis, (ii) to develop and improve the Services, (iii) to research trends and create
    predictive analysis; and (iv) to create and distribute aggregate reports and other materials regarding use of the
    Services.</p>
  <p><strong>2.7 Log Files</strong></p>
  <p>Basset uses log files on the server side. The data held in log files may include your IP address, browser type,
    e-mail application, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit websites, computer platform type, operating
    system, date/time stamp, and user activity. We use server log data to analyze trends in order to better understand
    use of the Services and to administer, manage and improve the Services. The software enabling the Services has
    associated temporary log files that are stored on Basset controlled servers, and these log files are copied into a
    third-party log aggregation tool. These logs may store your account information, preference settings, system
    notifications, and other data necessary to enable you to use the Services. Your information may also exist within
    regularly performed server backups. Our logs are retained for 90 days and our backups are retained for 30 days.</p>
  <p><strong>2.8 No Sensitive Personal Information</strong></p>
  <p>Basset does not intentionally collect or maintain, and we request that you do not post, upload, store, display,
    transmit, or submit Sensitive Personal Information on or through the Services. “Sensitive Personal Information”
    includes, but is not limited to, government-issued identification numbers, financial account numbers, credit or
    debit card numbers, consumer reports, financial information, background checks, biometric data, any code or password
    that could be used to gain access to personal accounts, or any information specifying medical and health conditions,
    racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, or the sex
    life of an individual.</p>
  <p>We rely on our Customers to ensure that they have obtained all necessary authority and consent to provide Personal
    Information to us for the purposes of the Services and to not provide us with sensitive personal information.
    Customers are solely responsible for all information you post, upload, store, display, transmit, or submit on the
    Services, including Sensitive Personal Information, and the consequences thereof. Basset is not responsible for and
    will not be liable to you or another individual for any loss or damages you or another individual may experience due
    to your disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information while using the Services.</p>
  <p><strong>2.9 Questions and Inquiries</strong></p>
  <p>When you contact Basset, by email, written correspondence, telephone calls, web-based forms, or otherwise, any
    information that you provide in such forum may also be collected and stored by Basset in order to facilitate the
    provision of Services and any related support for the Services. You may be asked for information that identifies you
    (such as your name, address and a phone number) along with additional information we need to help us promptly answer
    your question or respond to your comment or complaint. We may also retain this information to assist you in the
    future and to improve our customer service, product and service offerings</p>
  <p><strong>2.10 Marketing Communications</strong></p>
  <p>If you submit your personal information to us through our website and consent to communication for the purpose of
    marketing, Basset will provide you with personalized communications regarding our products and services. For
    example, if you request a demo or fill out a “Contact Me” web form, we will use the information you provide us to
    contact you about your interest in our products and services. You can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the
    unsubscribe in any of our emails.</p>
  <p><strong>3. Website Information</strong></p>
  <p><strong>3.1 Cookies</strong></p>
  <p>When you use and interact with the Services, we use “cookies” or other similar technologies to collect and store
    information related to your access to or use of the Services. A cookie is a small piece of information that a
    website can store on your device for later retrieval. We place a cookie on your hard drive or in “local storage”, a
    feature of your browser, to retain information locally regarding your usage. Cookies are used to manage
    authentication/login, provide analytics, remember your preferences, and otherwise monitor the functionality of and
    improve the Services. You may set your web browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to not accept certain
    cookies. However, if you decide not to accept cookies from our website, you may not be able to take advantage of all
    of the features of our websites.</p>
  <p>Our websites may also use a technology called “tracer tags” or “Web Beacons”. This technology allows us to
    understand which pages you visit on our website. These tracer tags are used to help us optimize and tailor our
    website for you and other future visitors to our website.</p>
  <p><strong>3.2 Analytics</strong></p>
  <p>We may use a third party such as Google Analytics to help us gather and analyze information about the areas visited
    on the websites (such as the pages most read, time spent, search terms and other engagement data) in order to
    evaluate and improve the user experience and the convenience of the websites.</p>
  <p><strong>4. How We Transfer and Disclose Information</strong></p>
  <p><strong>4.1 Limitations of Use and Disclosure</strong></p>
  <p>Basset will not sell, rent or otherwise disclose your Personal Information to any third party without your consent
    except as described in this Privacy Policy or as required or permitted by applicable law.</p>
  <p>Service Providers<br>
    Your personal information may be transferred (or otherwise made available) to our affiliates and other third parties
    who provide services on our behalf (e.g., email services, cloud computing services, data storage facilities, mailing
    services, logging, hosting, advertising and analytics services, payment processing). Our service providers are given
    the information they need to perform their designated functions, and are not authorized to use or disclose personal
    information for their own marketing or other purposes.</p>
  <p>Legal and Compliance<br>
    We and our Canadian, US and other service providers may provide your personal information in response to a search
    warrant or other legally valid inquiry or order, or to another organization for the purposes of investigating a
    breach of an agreement or contravention of law or detecting, suppressing or preventing fraud, or as otherwise
    required or permitted by applicable Canadian, US or other law or legal process. Your personal information may also
    be disclosed where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims and to investigate or
    prevent actual or suspected loss or harm to persons or property</p>
  <p>Sale of Business<br>
    Personal information may be provided to third parties in connection with an acquisition, debt financing,
    divestitures, financing, merger or sale (including transfers made as part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings)
    involving all or part of Basset or as part of a corporate reorganization or stock sale or other change in corporate
    control, including for the purpose of determining whether to proceed or continue with such transaction or business
    relationship</p>
  <p><strong>4.2 International Transfer of Information Collected</strong></p>
  <p>Basset operates out of Canada and stores information with service providers located in the United States. Your
    Personal Information may be maintained and processed by us, our affiliates and other third-party service providers
    in Canada, the United States or other jurisdictions where our service providers are located.</p>
  <p>We take measures to ensure that any Personal Information transfers comply with all applicable data protection laws
    and that your Personal Information remains protected to the standards described in this Privacy Policy. In the event
    that Personal Information is transferred to the US or other foreign jurisdiction, it will be subject to the laws of
    that jurisdiction and may be disclosed to or accessed by the courts, law enforcement and governmental authorities in
    accordance with those laws.</p>
  <p><strong>4.3 Third Party Websites</strong></p>
  <p>While using the Services or the Website, you may be directed to a third-party website, such as third party
    integrations, third party authenticators, or other links or references, which may take you to a third party website
    or service that Basset does not own or operate. Once you have left the Services, this Privacy Policy will no longer
    apply to you or any other data collected from or provided by you, including Personal Information, and you will be
    subject to that third party website’s privacy policy (and such other terms and conditions). You should review such
    third party website’s privacy policy to determine how your data will be used. We do not have any control over such
    services or websites, and therefore we have no responsibility or liability for the manner in which the organizations
    that operate such linked services or websites may collect, use or disclose, secure and otherwise treat your Personal
    Information.</p>
  <p><strong>5. Retention</strong></p>
  <p>We have retention processes designed to retain Personal Information for no longer than necessary for the purposes
    of providing Services to our Customers or as otherwise instructed by our Customers or, with respect to the Website,
    for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We may also retain personal information to meet legal requirements
    or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
  <p><strong>6. Security Measures</strong></p>
  <p>We take your privacy and data security very seriously and strive to maintain the security of all Personal
    Information. Basset maintains appropriate physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect against
    loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or destruction of Personal Information,
    including Hosted Data, in our custody and control. However, no website or transmission of information over the
    internet or common carrier lines is guaranteed to be completely secure, and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized
    access, hacking, data losses, or other breaches will never occur.</p>
  <p>Basset servers are managed and located at a third-party Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IAAS) provider, and we have
    taken commercially reasonable steps to choose a qualified IAAS provider that operates according to industry standard
    terms of service and data security protocols. Basset uses commercially reasonable efforts to store and encrypt
    Personal Information in a secure location, encrypt passwords, and utilize a minimum of 128-bit Secure Socket Layer
    (SSL) certificates to protect transactions to and from the Services.</p>
  <p>You will access and use the Services via a registered user account, which is also protected by a password for your
    privacy and security. You are responsible and liable for safeguarding your account and password that you use to
    access the Services, and for all activities or actions that occur under your account. You should take measures to
    prevent unauthorized access to your account and your information by selecting and protecting your password
    appropriately and limiting access to your computer (or other device) and browser by signing off after you have
    finished accessing your account. If you choose to authenticate your account through a Third-Party Authenticator, the
    security and privacy of your account is subject to the policies of such Third Party Authenticator and we have no
    liability for the applicable Third Party Authenticator’s security and privacy practices.</p>
  <p><strong>6. Access to Personal Information</strong></p>
  <p>If we receive a request from an individual to access, correct, update or delete Personal Information we have
    collected on behalf of a particular Customer in the course of providing the Services, we will direct that individual
    to the relevant Customer.</p>
  <p>Basset will work with the tool administrators at your company to respond in a timely manner to all reasonable
    written requests to view, modify, or delete Personal Information, subject to applicable law.</p>
  <p>If you submit Personal Information via our Website or otherwise directly provide us with Personal Information, you
    may request access, updating or correction of your personal information (subject to limited exceptions prescribed by
    law) by submitting a written request to us at the contact information below. We may request certain personal
    information for the purposes of verifying your identity.</p>
  <p><strong>7. Enforcement</strong></p>
  <p>Basset will actively monitor its relevant privacy and security practices to verify adherence to this Privacy
    Policy. Any agents, contractors, service providers, or other third party’s subject to this Privacy Policy that
    Basset determines is in violation of this Privacy Policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including
    termination of such services.</p>
  <p><strong>8. Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
  <p>Basset may change, modify, or update this Privacy Policy from time to time, in whole or in part, in Basset’s sole
    discretion, at any time without prior notice by posting updated versions on the Basset website. When we do, we will
    revise the “last updated” date at the bottom of this page. If and when we make such changes, we will make
    commercially reasonable efforts to notify you by email, through the Services, or by posting a prominent notice on
    our Website. We encourage you to visit this page at https://basset.io/privacy-policy to stay informed on our privacy
